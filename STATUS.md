## Current phase

**Phase 0 — Scaffold** (not started)

---

## Done

- 2026-05-03 — Planning docs (7 files in `docs/` + this tracker)

---

## In progress

## Up next

**Phase 0.1**: `npx create-next-app@latest` with TS, app router, Tailwind, ESLint.

Then 0.2: create Supabase project and grab keys.

See [docs/07-build-plan.md §Phase 0](docs/07-build-plan.md) for the full task list.

## Decisions log (the durable ones)

> Append-only. When a decision changes, add a new entry rather than editing the old one — leaves an audit trail.

- 2026-05-03 — **Stack**: Next.js on Vercel + Supabase (Postgres / Auth / Realtime / Storage) + Plaid (Limited Production) + Twilio WhatsApp sandbox + Anthropic Claude Haiku + Upstash QStash + cron-job.org. See [docs/01-architecture.md](docs/01-architecture.md).
- 2026-05-03 — **Auth**: email/password via Supabase. Not magic link, not Google OAuth. Reason: faster login UX for one user.
- 2026-05-03 — **Twilio sandbox indefinitely**, not approved templates. Reason: single user, no friction, no template review delay. Reassess only if we ever expand to other users.
- 2026-05-03 — **Splits support 4 modes**: `none`, `percent`, `fixed`, `ratio`. Store both `split_value` (computed) and `split_raw_input` (the user's literal text).
- 2026-05-03 — **Refund auto-pair**: only same merchant + exact amount within 30 days. Different-amount refunds left standalone for manual linking later.
- 2026-05-03 — **Pending → posted re-notify**: only when amount Δ > 5% OR category changed.
- 2026-05-03 — **Always guess, never ask**: WA notification always commits a category. User corrects via reply.
- 2026-05-03 — **Store every Plaid response verbatim**: `plaid_webhooks.payload` (jsonb) for inbound, `transactions.raw` (jsonb) per-row, `app_events` for the full sync response.
- 2026-05-03 — **Transfer pairing is synchronous** at the end of `categorize_transaction` to avoid the WA-notification race. `pair_refund` stays async.

## Open questions to resolve during build

- Pending coverage on Robinhood and PayPal — verify when first transactions land in P1.
- Whether `effective_amount` works as a Postgres generated column with our split logic, or needs a trigger. Verify in P2.1.
- QStash free-tier limit (500 msg/day) holds in practice — measure during P2/P3.
- Twilio sandbox session: confirm "join {keyword}" doesn't silently expire. Note any reconnect events.

## Notes

(Use this section for one-off observations or todos that don't fit elsewhere — e.g., "the Chase Plaid item flagged ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED on day 3, took 6 hours for me to notice — surface this faster.")
